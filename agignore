# The Silver Searcher (ag) agignore File
#
# IGNORING FILES
#
# By default, ag will ignore files whose names match patterns in .gitignore,
# .hgignore, or .ignore. These files can be anywhere in the directories being
# searched. Binary files are ignored by default as well. Finally, ag looks in
# $HOME/.agignore for ignore patterns.
#
# See the documentation:
