## Migrating

https://github.com/minuteman3/migration-checklist-poster/tree/main

- [ ] Before removing columns: ensure the columns have been added to
  `self.ignored_columns` on the model in a previous pull request.
- [ ] Ensure proper indexes are in place if this changes a default scope.
- [ ] Ensure your migration PR contains only your migration files and updated
  schema files. No files outside the `db` directory should be changed.
- [ ] **Don't merge the PR with your application changes before you complete all
  the steps in this checklist.**
- [ ] If you're making more than one change then use `change_table` and set
  `bulk: true` in the options. This will run multiple changes in a single
  statement so that if a single statement fails the server will rollback the
  entire operation, instead of leaving the migration in a half-done. If in
  doubt, use `change_table :table_name, bulk: true do |t|` everywhere.
- [ ] Your PR must contain the schema.rb file updated. If your migration file
  has an older timestamp, you leave (version: timestamp) untouched in schema.rb
  as you can't make the migration go back in time.
- [ ] Ensure you have run both `db:migrate:up VERSION=YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` and
  `db:migrate:down VERSION=YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` on your local machine, where the
  version timestamp corresponds to the timestamp in your generated migration
  filename.
- [ ] Add the output of the `db:migrate:up` and `db:migrate:down` commands as
  a comment to this PR.
- [ ] Merge your PR
- [ ] Wait until your change has been deployed to production
- [ ] Ensure your migration is not going to run at peak time
- [ ] Run your migration: `rake db:migrate:up VERSION=YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`
- [ ] Ensure `db/seeds.rb` has been updated to reflect the changes in the
  migration
